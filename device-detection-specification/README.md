# Introduction

This folder structure contains a language agnostic specification for a device detection engine that can be used by the [51Degrees v4 Pipeline API](../pipeline-specification/README.md). 
We aim to avoid specific details of classes, interfaces, methods or the like. The focus is on the behaviour rather than the method by which that behaviour is achieved. This allows implementers to choose an architectural approach that is most appropriate and familiar for uses of the target language.

# Structure

This specification is broken down into separate markdown files in multiple directories.
If you're not sure where to start, we recommend looking at [use cases](use-cases.md) first.
