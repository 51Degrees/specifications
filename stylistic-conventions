# Stylistic Conventions

## Spelling

US English

C# this should be spelled in uppercase

metadata all one word

website all one word

start-up - as in "does x on start-up"

on-premise

JSON uppercase

## Capitalization

Defined Terms:

- Pipeline
- Flow Element
- Flow Data
- Engine and all specializations of Engines e.g.
Aspect Engine,
Cloud Aspect Engine,
Cloud Request Engine, On-premise Engine, Cloud Engine
- Evidence
- Property
- Element Data
- Flow Data
- Resource Key
- Aspect

Defined Terms are Capitalized.

Where defined terms are introduced, in Conceptual overview and introductory
material, they are **emboldened** on first occurrence.

Pluralized forms of Defined Terms are capitalized.

Ancillary words that go to make a noun phrase from a defined term are not
capitalized. e.g. Pipeline builder. Aspect Element builder. Property metadata.

Class names, interface names and method names are rendered in monospace e.g. `process`

When referring to an implementation class which is an instantiation
of a concept that has a Defined Term, the name of
the class is used and rendered in monospace e.g. `FlowData`

Tables:
- Bold column headers
- Equal space columns

RFC 2119 terms are UPPER CASE when used with the meaning defined in RFC 2119.
Avoid use of the same terms where they do not have the RFC 2119 meaning.

MUST, SHOULD, MUST NOT, SHOULD NOT, MAY etc.

Section heads use sentence case.

When a section head contains a defined term the term retains its
capitalization e.g. Flow Element, and Flow Element builder. The logic for this
is that sentence case would have you say, for example,
"Taking a trip to Buenos Aires"
