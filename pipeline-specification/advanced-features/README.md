All the features described in this section have substantial impacts
on other parts of the API, particularly areas such as
[resource cleanup](../features/resource-cleanup.md)
and [thread safety](../features/thread-safety.md).

Most are not implemented in all Pipeline API languages. Either due
to complexity or simply not being possible.

Most also provide questionable benefits to justify this complexity.

Whether these features are implemented or not will need to be carefully
considered and agreed up front.
