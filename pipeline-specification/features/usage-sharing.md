# Usage sharing

Users of 51Degrees products have the option to send usage data to us.

This process is very important to us, as well as to users, as it is
used to help improve the accuracy of our products.

For example, our Device Detection product relies on usage data from
customers to give us a good view of what user-agents, client-hints, etc
are active in the real world.
This is a constantly evolving picture, so good quality data is
essential.

Data is shared in XML format, with multiple process requests aggregated
to produce each payload.

Shared data includes details such as:
- Evidence values
- **Pipeline** configuration.
- OS, programming language and API versions.

For more technical details, see the
[share usage element](../pipeline-elements/usage-sharing-element.md).
