- In general user-facing data structures do not need to be thread-safe. - better performance, user can ensure that they handle the data in a thread safe way if they need to.
  - Where the pipeline contains elements running in parallel, some data structures will need to be updated in a thread safe manner.
- aspect data instances must be thread-safe. If this is not possible, the engine must not support [caching](caching.md)
