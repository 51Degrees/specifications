- Engines often have one or more associated data files.
- There must be a feature that allows these data files to be updated automatically.
- The engine should take all steps to minimize blocking of process requests during the data update process. (a small amount of blocking is generally unavoidable)
- Support Update on startup
- Allow randomization of update time
- Support MD5
- Support decompression of downloaded file
- Support if-modified-since header - using values from the data file that are exposed by the engine
- Support for customizable flat or parameterized URLs (where parameters based on values in the data file and exposed by the engine)
- Support for the user updating the file on disk, causing the engine to reload its in-memory data.
- Support for manually forcing a refresh of the data file from code.
- Support for filesystem-less environments. I.e. the file data only ever exists in memory.
- logging should be used to give users a clear picture of what is happening should they want it.
- Events, callbacks, etc should be used to allow users to act on updates starting/completing.
