- Multiple ways to access results from processing 
  - get element's data by type
  - get element's data by string
  - get property value from element's data by strongly-typed property
  - get property value from element's data by string
  - get property directly from flow data by string (do we want to include this in the spec? It's not demonstrated, isn't type-safe and isn't used internally.)
