# Usage sharing element

This Flow Element implements the [usage-sharing](../features/usage-sharing.md)
feature.

## Accepted Evidence

The accepted Evidence for share usage is unusual as it cannot simply be a
list of accepted keys like most Flow Elements.

Instead, it is a filter function that will need to return false (i.e. not shared)
for any key where:

- Prefix = `header.` and field is in a user-configurable block list
  (by default, this block list SHOULD include the `cookies` HTTP header).
- Prefix = `cookie.` and field does not start with `51D_`
- Prefix = `query.` and field does not start with `51D_` and is not in a
  user-configurable allow list of query string parameters that will be
  shared.

Anything else MUST return true. (i.e. it will be shared)

See [configuration options](#configuration-options) for more detail on the
configuration parameters that can affect this filter function.

## Element Data

This Flow Element does not add an Element Data instance to Flow Data.

## Start-up activity

A static XML snippet can be generated for values that will be invariant
for the lifetime of the current Pipeline.

From the list of parameters in the processing section below, the invariant ones
are:

- Version
- Product
- Flow Elements
- Language
- LanguageVersion
- ServerIP
- Platform

Note that there is a [proposal](../future-features/usage-sharing-header.md) to
avoid duplicating these values on every record.

## Processing

The process function SHOULD get the data it needs and complete as soon as
possible.
We recommend implementing a producer/consumer approach where the process
function just adds the raw data to a shared queue.

A background thread can then be used to consume items from this queue,
adding them to the XML payload and sending it once it contains the
configured quantity of data.

The complete XML document MUST contain a `<Devices>` root element with
each `<Device>` element containing the details related to a request.

Multiple `<Device>` elements will be batched up as part of each message.
The number of items per batch is configurable using the
[minimum entries per message](#configuration-options) setting.

In the snippet below:

- Text in CAPS represent variable values.
- Things in [square brackets] are optional

```xml
<Device>
  <SessionId>SESSION_ID</SessionId> 
  <Sequence>SEQUENCE</Sequence> 
  <DateSent>DATE_SENT</DateSent> 
  <Version>API_VERSION</Version> 
  <Product>API_NAME</Product>  
  <FlowElement>ELEMENT1</FlowElement> 
  <FlowElement>ELEMENT2</FlowElement>  
  <Language>LANG</Language> 
  <LanguageVersion>LANG_VERSION</LanguageVersion> 
  <ClientIP>IP_ADDRESS</ClientIP> 
  <ServerIP>IP_ADDRESS</ServerIP> 
  <Platform>PLATFORM PLATFORM_VER SERVICE_PACK</Platform> 
  <!--Each evidence value is represented as an entry in the form:--> 
  <PREFIX [escaped=true] [truncated=true] Name="FIELD">VALUE</PREFIX> 
  <!--For example:--> 
  <Header Name="user-agent">USER_AGENT</Header> 
  <Header Name="host">HOST</Header>
  <Cookie Name="51d_screenpixelsheight">SCREEN_HEIGHT</Cookie> 
</Device> 
```

- **SessionId** – A GUID generated by the [Sequence Element](sequence-element.md)
  used to identify a set of Evidence originating from the same source where
  multiple requests are initiated to resolve the JSON payload for
  updated Evidence, e.g. client-side overrides or geo location.
- **Sequence** – An integer paired with the SessionId which is incremented
  each time the sequence value is seen in Evidence to identify the number
  of requests in a session. (This incrementing is handled by the Sequence Element)
- **DateSent** - The date that the xml was constructed in UTC and formatted
  as: yyyy-mm-ddThh:nn:ss
- **Version** - The version of the Pipeline that is being used to generate
  the xml. E.g. “4.0”
- **Product** - The name of the product that is generating the xml. For
  example, “Pipeline”
- **FlowElement** – An xml element exists for each FlowElement in the
  Pipeline. The text contains the fully qualified class name of the FlowElement.
- **Language** - The name of the language/framework within which the
  Pipeline is running.
- **LanguageVersion** - The version number of the language/framework
  within which the Pipeline is running.
- **ClientIP** - Public IP address of the client that sent the request to
  this server.
- **ServerIP** - IP address of the server where the xml is being generated.
- **Platform** - The platform name, version and service pack if available.
- **Evidence** – The Evidence that is shared will be determined by the
  [accepted Evidence](#accepted-evidence).

Evidence values can be extremely long, or contain characters that are not
permitted in XML. In order to handle this, some mechanism MUST be implemented
to sanitize the values before they are added to the XML.

Where changes need to be made to the value, attributes are added to the XML
element for that Evidence entry to let the reader know the value was modified.

Currently, the defined attributes are:

- escaped - Indicates that the original evidence value included invalid
  characters, which have been replaced with escaped ones.
- truncated - Indicates that the original evidence value was too long. The
  value in the XML does not include all characters from the original.

See the [ReplacedString](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-java/blob/master/pipeline.engines.fiftyone/src/main/java/fiftyone/pipeline/engines/fiftyone/flowelements/ShareUsageElement.java#L485)
function in Java for an example of this.

### Request detail

When sending the data, use the following details:

- URL configurable using the [share usage URL](#configuration-options) option.
- POST request
- XML content written to the body of the request using GZip compression
- HTTP Headers:
  - content-encoding = gzip
  - content-type = text/xml

Response will be a 200 on success. Anything else is a failure.
When failures occur, the status code and content of the response MUST be logged
to aid troubleshooting.

See the [BuildAndSendXml](https://github.com/51Degrees/pipeline-dotnet/blob/master/FiftyOne.Pipeline.Engines.FiftyOne/FlowElements/ShareUsageElement.cs#L104) method in C# for an example of this.

## Session tracking

Note that this section is not concerned with actually identifying
the precise boundaries of user sessions. Just with reducing the volume
of unnecessary data that is shared.

When a user is browsing a website, they will typically make many HTTP
requests to access different resources, visit different pages, etc.

These requests will usually all generate exactly the same usage data.
We have no need for this duplicate data, so it MUST be discarded as
early as possible.

This can be achieved by maintaining a data structure containing
recently shared Evidence values. If the data entry being processed
already has a matching entry in this data structure, it MUST NOT
be shared. For example, the C# implementation generates a hash of the
Evidence values using the same logic as the [caching](../features/caching.md)
feature.

Entries will have a configurable lifetime within this data structure.
This is reset each time an entry with matching Evidence values is
processed.

See [configuration options](#configuration-options) for more detail
on customizing this lifetime.

Note that certain Evidence values MUST NOT be included in the generation
of this hash code as they are designed to make a request unique.
For example, the sequence number generated by the
[Sequence Element](sequence-element.md).

We also include various [configuration options](#configuration-options)
for users to exclude any keys that might be identified to cause
oversharing of data.

## Error handling

As a general principle, share usage can be considered an important, but expendable
activity. If errors occur then they MUST be handled and
[logged](../features/logging.md) without disrupting anything else the Pipeline is doing.

For example, the queue of data to be sent has limited size. If this
becomes full, additional data can simply be discarded until there
is room to add entries again.
However, it is important that these actions are logged so that users
can identify potential issues with their usage sharing.

## Cleanup

As this element uses a producer/consumer queue and background processing,
it will need to handle cleanup a little more carefully than other elements.

1. If needed, block while the consumer sends data waiting in the queue.
2. Send a final message with any data remaining in the queue (even if it is
   less than the configured minimum batch size)
3. Free any resources associated with the queue and background processing.
